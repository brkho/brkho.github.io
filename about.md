## Personal
Hi, I'm Brian! I'm a software engineer based out of San Francisco with a keen interest in video game design, computer graphics, and the ever-majestic SF BART.

Over the years, I've worked on a few personal projects related to CG and games. Here are some highlights:
- Networked browser game <a href="https://github.com/brkho/archipelago-server">(server)</a> <a href="https://github.com/brkho/archipelago-client">(client)</a>: An untitled fast-paced browser game that networks with an authoritative server via WebRTC. This is a work in progress.
- Liang Renderer <a href="https://github.com/brkho/liang-renderer">(link)</a>: A toy physically based ray tracer modeled after `pbrt`. This is a work in progress that gets attention when I want to take a break from interactive media.
- real-time-pbr <a href="https://github.com/brkho/real-time-pbr">(link)</a>: A physically based real-time renderer based on <a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/#course_content">UE4's shading model</a>.
- A 3D game engine written in Rust <a href="https://github.com/brkho/3d-engine-rust">(link)</a>: traditional forward renderer using the Rust OpenGL bindings.

## Professional
As far as my professional life goes, I currently work at Dropbox, where I'm building a great productivity tool called <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com">Paper</a>. Previously, I worked on the Knowledge Graph at Google and news feed ranking at Facebook. The views expressed in this blog are my own and do not represent the views of my employer.
